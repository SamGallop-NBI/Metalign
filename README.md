# Metalign: Efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling via containment min hash

Version 0.12.5 | May 29, 2020 

Metalign is a method for estimating the taxonomic composition and relative abundances of organisms in a metagenomic sample based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing reads. 

For instructions on usage, please see the wiki: https://github.com/nlapier2/Metalign/wiki

Once you've completed installation, a quick example (with instructions) is available in the example/ folder.
